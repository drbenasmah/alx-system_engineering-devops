What Happens When You Type "google.com" in Your Browser?
When you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a series of behind-the-scenes processes occur to bring you to the Google search engine. This README aims to provide a brief overview of the journey your request takes and the technologies involved.

Overview
DNS Resolution:

Your browser sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver to translate the domain name "google.com" into an IP address.
The DNS resolver recursively traverses the DNS hierarchy to find the IP address associated with "google.com".
Establishing a Connection:

Once the IP address is obtained, your browser establishes a TCP/IP connection to the server hosting the Google website.
The connection is typically made on port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS.
Encryption and Security:

If you typed "https://google.com" instead of "http://google.com," the connection is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
SSL/TLS ensures that the data exchanged between your browser and the server remains private and secure.
Firewall:

The request passes through firewalls, which act as security measures to filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Firewalls enforce rules and policies to protect against unauthorized access and potential threats.
Load Balancing:

In high-traffic scenarios, the request may pass through load balancers.
Load balancers distribute the incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and improve scalability.
Web Server:

The request reaches the web server, which is responsible for processing the request and generating a response.
The web server serves the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets required to render the Google search page.
Application Logic:

In the case of Google, the web server might communicate with various application servers in the backend.
Application servers handle the server-side logic, such as processing search queries and generating personalized search results.
Data Storage:

Application servers may interact with databases to retrieve and store data required for generating search results.
Databases provide efficient data storage and retrieval capabilities to handle the vast amount of information handled by search engines like Google.
Conclusion
The process of typing "google.com" in your browser involves multiple steps, including DNS resolution, establishing connections, encryption, firewall checks, load balancing, web server response, application logic, and data storage. Understanding this journey offers insights into the underlying technologies that power our web browsing experiences.
