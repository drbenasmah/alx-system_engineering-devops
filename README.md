API Data Processing Python Scripts

Background Context
As the world of system administration evolves, a new generation of professionals known as SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) has emerged. Unlike the traditional system administrators who primarily rely on Bash scripting, SREs are well-versed in various programming languages, including Python, to manage and maintain systems more efficiently.

One prevalent method to expose application functionality and data is through an API (Application Programming Interface). APIs serve as the public-facing part of websites and microservices, enabling external parties to interact with the application, access its data, and perform modifications. In this project, we will utilize Python scripts to access employee data via an API, organize it, and export it into different data structures.

Bash scripting may suffice for some tasks, but when it comes to more complex data processing and management, Python proves to be a powerful and suitable language.

Resources
Before diving into the project, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script
What is an API?
What is a REST API?
What are microservices?
PEP 8 Python style
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following requirements met before running the Python scripts:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
Required Python packages installed. Install them using the following command:

pip install requests
Getting Started
To begin using the API data processing Python scripts, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-data-processing.git
Change into the project directory:

cd api-data-processing
Set up your API access credentials:

Open the config.py file.
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key.
Run the Python script to process employee data:


python process_employee_data.py
Usage
The process_employee_data.py script fetches employee data from the API, organizes it, and exports it into different data structures. By default, the script outputs the data to the console, but you can modify it to save the data to a file or integrate it into your own applications.

Feel free to explore and modify the script according to your specific use case and requirements.
