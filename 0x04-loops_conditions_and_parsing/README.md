0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
This project covers the basics of loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting. It is a part of the DevOps curriculum and focuses on the following topics:

Creation of SSH keys
Use of while, until, and for loops
Use of if, else, elif, and case condition statements
Use of comparison operators and file test operators
Portability of scripts
Use of the cut command
Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All files should end with a new line
A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
All Bash script files must be executable
awk is not allowed
Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing
Tasks
0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
In this task, we create an SSH RSA key pair, share the public key in the answer file 0-RSA_public_key.pub, and fill the SSH public key field of our intranet profile with the generated public key.

1. For Best School loop
In this task, we write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a for loop.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, we should be able to:

Create SSH keys
Understand the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
Use while, until, and for loops
Use if, else, elif, and case condition statements
Use the cut command
Understand comparison operators and file test operators, and how to use them
Make scripts portable
